Reporting Module

Provides a dedicated location for report and export utilities built on top
of the Chapter 4 mathematical model.

At present:
- `results_display.generate_clinical_report` builds a clinical-style text report
- `results_display.display_export_options` exposes download buttons for TXT and CSV

This module can later host:
- PDF or FHIR-based report generation
- Integration with EMR/EHR systems
- Batch export of synthetic or clinical cohorts
"""

# For now, high-level reporting helpers are implemented in `results_display.py`.
